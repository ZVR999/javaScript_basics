            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScriptis extremely popular for a variety
                of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it
                in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
                it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup
                    you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a vaule. All JavaScript variables must
                    be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                    <span class="purple">var x</span>;</li>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                    have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value
                    to a variable.
                    <span class="purple">var x = 10;</span>
                </li>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -
                    <span class="purple">true</span> or
                    <span class="purple">false</span>;
                    <span class="purple">null</span>
                    - null aka nothing; Number -
                    <span class="purple">42</span> or
                    <span class="purple">3.14159</span>; String -
                    <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array -
                    <span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>
                    and Object -
                    <span class="purple">{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions -
                    hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
                    statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following condtitional statements:
                    <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                    <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                    <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially
                    do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well
                    you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                </li>
                <li class="whiteBullet">
                    <a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                    that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together
                    a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table
                    top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a
                    ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
